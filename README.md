# Asana WebDev Take-Home Exercise Submission

## Summary

The Asana Pet Adoption Agency page was built with only vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. It is a lightweight single-page site that draws primarily on CSS animations and CSS only UI components (material buttons and drawn icons) to increase performance and loading speed.

I would like the page to be graded on Design Focus. The page is cross-browser and mobile responsive.

## Additional Details

The fetchDogs() method assumes the 2000 total pets will be fetched in groups of fifteen. To simulate displaying more than the initial number of pets, the same fifteen are gotten each time "See More" is clicked.
